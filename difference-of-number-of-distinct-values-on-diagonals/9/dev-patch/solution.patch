- Given a 0-indexed 2D grid of size m x n, you should find the matrix answer of size m x n.
-The value of each cell (r, c) of the matrix answer is calculated in the following way:
 
-Let topLeft[r][c] be the number of distinct values in the top-left diagonal of the cell (r, c) in the matrix grid.
-Let bottomRight[r][c] be the number of distinct values in the bottom-right diagonal of the cell (r, c) in the matrix grid.
-
-Then answer[r][c] = |topLeft[r][c] - bottomRight[r][c]|.
-Return the matrix answer.
-A matrix diagonal is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right direction until reaching the matrix's end.
-A cell (r1, c1) belongs to the top-left diagonal of the cell (r, c), if both belong to the same diagonal and r1 < r. Similarly is defined bottom-right diagonal.
- 
-Example 1:
-
-
-
-Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[3,1,5],[3,2,1]]
-Output: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1]]
-Explanation: The 1 ** st diagram denotes the initial grid. 
-The 2 ** nd diagram denotes a grid for cell (0,0), where blue-colored cells are cells on its bottom-right diagonal.
-The 3 ** rd diagram denotes a grid for cell (1,2), where red-colored cells are cells on its top-left diagonal.
-The 4 ** th diagram denotes a grid for cell (1,1), where blue-colored cells are cells on its bottom-right diagonal and red-colored cells are cells on its top-left diagonal.
-- The cell (0,0) contains [1,1] on its bottom-right diagonal and [] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |1 - 0| = 1.
-- The cell (1,2) contains [] on its bottom-right diagonal and [2] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |0 - 1| = 1.
-- The cell (1,1) contains [1] on its bottom-right diagonal and [1] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |1 - 1| = 0.
-The answers of other cells are similarly calculated.
-
-Example 2:
-
-Input: grid = [[1]]
-Output: [[0]]
-Explanation: - The cell (0,0) contains [] on its bottom-right diagonal and [] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |0 - 0| = 0.

-Constraints:
-
-m == grid.length
-n == grid[i].length
-1 <= m, n, grid[i][j] <= 50
