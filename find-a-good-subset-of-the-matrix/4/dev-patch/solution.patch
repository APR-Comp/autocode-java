-/**java 
- You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix grid.
-Let us call a non-empty subset of rows good if the sum of each column of the subset is at most half of the length of the subset.
-More formally, if the length of the chosen subset of rows is k, then the sum of each column should be at most floor(k / 2).
-Return an integer array that contains row indices of a good subset sorted in ascending order.
-If there are multiple good subsets, you can return any of them. If there are no good subsets, return an empty array.
-A subset of rows of the matrix grid is any matrix that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) rows from grid.
- 
-Example 1:
+import java.util.stream.*;
 
-Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]
-Output: [0,1]
-Explanation: We can choose the 0 ** th and 1 ** st rows to create a good subset of rows.
-The length of the chosen subset is 2.
-- The sum of the 0 ** th column is 0 + 0 = 0, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
-- The sum of the 1 ** st column is 1 + 0 = 1, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
-- The sum of the 2 ** nd column is 1 + 0 = 1, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
-- The sum of the 3 ** rd column is 0 + 1 = 1, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
-
-Example 2:
-
-Input: grid = [[0]]
-Output: [0]
-Explanation: We can choose the 0 ** th row to create a good subset of rows.
-The length of the chosen subset is 1.
-- The sum of the 0 ** th column is 0, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
-
-Example 3:
-
-Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
-Output: []
-Explanation: It is impossible to choose any subset of rows to create a good subset.
-
- 
-Constraints:
-
-m == grid.length
-n == grid[i].length
-1 <= m <= 10 ** 4
-1 <= n <= 5
-grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
